AIM : BANKERS DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE ALGORITHM

ALGORITHM:

Step-1: Start the program.
Step-2: Declare the memory for the process.
Step-3: Read the number of process, resources, allocation matrix and available matrix.
Step-4: Compare each and every process using the bankerâ€Ÿs algorithm.
Step-5: If the process is in safe state then it is a not a deadlock process otherwise it is a
deadlock process
Step-6: produce the result of state of process
Step-7: Stop the program
