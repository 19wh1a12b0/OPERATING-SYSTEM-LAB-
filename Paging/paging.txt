AIM  :  To write a C program to implement memory management using paging technique.

ALGORITHM:

	Step 1 : Read the base address, page size, number of pages and memory unit.
	Step 2 : If the memory limit is less than the base address display the memory limit is less than limit.
	Step 3 : Create the page table with the number of pages and page address.
	Step 4 : Read the page number and displacement value.
	Step 5 : If the page number and displacement value is valid, add the displacement value with the address corresponding to the page number and display the result.
	Step 6 : Display the page is not found or displacement should be less than page size.
