AIM:
 To write a C program for implementation of Round Robin scheduling algorithms.

ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Inside the structure declare the variables.
Step 2: Declare the variable i,j as integer, totwtime and totttime is equal to zero.
Step 3: Get the value of „n‟ assign p and allocate the memory.
Step 4: Inside the for loop get the value of burst time and priority and read the time quantum.
Step 5: Assign wtime as zero.
Step 6: Check p[i].pri is greater than p[j].pri .
Step 7: Calculate the total of burst time and waiting time and assign as turnaround time.
Step 8: Stop the program.
