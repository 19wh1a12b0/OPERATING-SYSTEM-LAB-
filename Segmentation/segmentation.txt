AIM  :  To write a C program to implement memory management using segmentation technique.

ALGORITHM:

	Step 1 : Read the base address, number of segments, size of each segment, memory limit.
	Step 2 : If memory address is less than the base address display “invalid memory limit”.
	Step 3 : Create the segment table with the segment number and segment address and display it.
	Step 4 : Read the segment number and displacement.
	Step 5 : If the segment number and displacement is valid compute the real address and display the same.
